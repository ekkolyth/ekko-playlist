# Icons

Place your extension icons here:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editor. The icons should represent a YouTube playlist scanner.

For quick testing, you can create simple colored squares or use a YouTube-related icon.
